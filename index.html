    Hi there! My name is Tristin and I'm a newly established web developer. 
    My current specialties include HTML and CSS, but I will be adding more to my repertoire over the next six months.
     In my short time as a developer, I have seen many animal pictures and learned how to make boxes float accross
     the page according to my whims. HTML is fun, isn't it? Although if you asked me that while I was completing 
     the homework recently, I may have said differently. Very differently. But I digress.
</p>
<p>
    My other hobbies include reading young adult fiction and reddit while baking delicious homemade goods for my
    friends and family. My favorite right now is a very subtle and succulent version of my great aunt's Dark Chocolate
    Chocolate Chip Brownies, which garner more enthusiasm from adults than kids, though the kiddies eat them up all the same.
</p>
<p>
    I own two very large, very mischievious goldfish that like to unearth the plants in their home (my 46-gallon aquarium)
    while otherwise hunting for food morsels and lazing the day away. 
</p>
<p>    
    It is a myth that goldfish don't remember things for very long. In fact, goldfish have been recorded as remembering things up to 3 months later, and I can certainly 
    tell you that mine get just as excited to see me as any dog or cat when I approach their tank. Nevermind that I am The One Who Brings Foods.
    I'm sticking to my story - just as I am sticking to the fact that I am going to be a great developer one day.
